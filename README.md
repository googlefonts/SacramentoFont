# Sacramento Font Project
by Astigmatic (AOETI)

The Sacramento typeface is a monoline, semi-connected script inspired by hand-lettering artist brochure work of the 1950's and 1960's. It stands on a thin line between formal and casual lettering styles, yet it has a commanding presence for headlines and titles.

This project is a fork from the old Google font repository.
